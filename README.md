# Algorithms 4th Edition in C++
This repo is the C++ implementation of Algorithms textbook by Professor Sedgewick and Professor Wayne. The latest edition of the book is in Java, and thus this library
attemps to convert many of the APIs and code into C++.

The basic requirement to use this repo is CMake. I've written GUI portion of the library using SFML and some part of Dear ImGui. The majority of the GUI portion is in
SFML, but I've added ImGui to change variables without recompiling the code again. The ImGui section of the code will be commented out, but you are welcome to add 
if you wish to do so.
